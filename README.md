In this project I will save all the tasks completed on FCC platform. 
Each task will be saved in separate file, named in numerical order. with section letters in the begining. E.g. js01-75 (JavaScript, part 1, task 75)
 I started to push to GitHub from task #75 "Golf Code" because first 74 are pretty easy and don't require too much effort.
